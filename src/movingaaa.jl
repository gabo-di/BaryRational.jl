# TODO
# 1. see fit of gaussian, polynomial (data only in x, on x y, which point is more probable)
#       pol fit is nice with few points, gaussian not, it uses the one that is further from mean(f)
# 1. see if I can add and delete elements of vector on struct
#       I can
#
# 1. do not move the points order on movingAAAapprox, use array permutations and views
    # i. we need J vector on the struct 
        #  done but maybe change A so the W is the same as in aaa
# 1. maybe check bary and derivative functions so they use each index and are compatible with movingAAAapprox 
#       maybe not necesary, seems to have good loops?
# 1. re fit of movingAAAapprox
